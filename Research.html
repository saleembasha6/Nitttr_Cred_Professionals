Thus, rights relating to ownership of intellectual property are called Intellectual Property Rights.

However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly rural tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.</p>

                        <p class="card-text mt-3">The Academic Audit, like more traditional program reviews, is a peer review process
including a self-study and a site visit by peers from outside the institution. However,
the similarities end there. Unlike the traditional approach to program evaluation, this
process emphasizes self-reflection and self-improvement rather than compliance
with predetermined standards. The purpose of an academic audit is to encourage
departments or programs to evaluate their “education quality processes” – the key
faculty activities required to produce, assure, and regularly improve the quality of
teaching and learning.
